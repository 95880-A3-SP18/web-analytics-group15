He investigated how the manner in we think affects how we speak, move and perform activities in our lives. He looked for ways to apply the principles of the Alexander Technique to develop more ease in daily activities and more freedom of expression in artistic activities. He termed this approach psycho-physical re-education. The Alexander Technique provides individuals with tools, including gentle hands on guidance by the teacher, to address specific habits of tension that may be impeding effectiveness. The technique is particularly valuable for performers such as actors, singers and musicians as well as visual artists. The course is also useful for those in business, medicine, law or any field where she  or he has to present ideas to groups. This course will introduce basic principles of the Alexander Technique and guide students in approaches to apply these principles to fine arts such as acting, playing a musical instrument, drawing, dancing as well as day to day activities such as working at a desk with a computer, public speaking, working out, etc. Participants should wear loose fitting clothing for each movement such as sweat pants and tee shirts, no jeans, ties or belts please.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.

As a class, we will consider how different historical moments have constructed gender in order to more fully understand how gender interacts with political and cultural ideologies of the present. Finally, this course will consider how gender has been critiqued as both the primary category of social identification and a primary category amongst others like race, class, sexuality and nationality.  As a class we will explore: How does gender influence the relationships between art, performance and spectatorship? In what ways has the rise of capitalism contributed to a narrative of gender categorization, and what is the role of the public and private spheres in the construction of gender identities? What are the connections between gender, politics, institutional change and human rights? How can language serve as a means of inquiry for critiquing representations of gender? Is globalization changing our conceptions of gender and in what ways can a sense of cosmopolitanism complicate feminist movements? In what ways can feminist and queer theories offer avenues of thought for future gender studies?"

The course will focus on stages of Smart City development and the design of New Urban Systems for mobility, energy, communication, food,, living  working. We will explore how the design of these systems can be resilient, scalable, and reconfigurable. Smart City is defined as a city which makes use of integrated thinking, modern urban design and Information and Communication technologies to manage infrastructures more efficiently, offer services provided rationally, provide a higher quality of service to citizens, wherein all its players (citizens, local companies and local Government) interact with each other to evolve and improve their activity. This interoperability requires the support of smart networks and platforms.  The focus will be on the technology and information infrastructure requirements for smart cities and ways to measure success. We will develop frameworks to identify problems fit for Smart City consideration in view of the local socio-economic challenges, including the funding of such cross-functional projects.   The course on Smart Cities will be a 6-credit course and would cover the following modules:   A. What is Smartness? What are Smart cities? B. Policy and Funding Issues - Socio-economic issues  C: Systems Thinking: Whole-brain approach for Integration of ideas D. Telecommunications  Sensors ? Networked infrastructure  E.

This course is designed to help students develop an integrated marketing communications plan to build enduring brand values. Students will focus on developing an effective MarCom plan and evaluating its effectiveness. The objective is to optimize the effectiveness of a given advertising budget while placing messages for mass or customized audiences by integrating several elements of a promotion mix-advertising, sales promotions, sponsorship, and interactive marketing-based on brand objectives. Whereas advertising is often seen as the central element of a marketing communications mix to build brand equity, it is not usually the only one, and very often not even the most important one.    The course is designed in three parts. Part 1 focuses on frameworks for brand management used to selecting target audiences and set communications objectives. Part 2 focuses on the evaluation of alternative creative messages, testing ad effectiveness, and assessing the effectiveness of the mix as a whole (traditional and non traditional media). The final part of the course discusses non traditional media, and the Internet/changing media environment."

Two important sub-themes are:   i. Underlying principles driving risk management ii. Application of these principles by designing, and implementing real time algorithmic trading strategies.             For the first sub-theme we start by developing the theory of how growth, leverage, and liquidity drive volatility in the banking sector.  In response to these relationships the Basel standards have evolved including for example, the Pillar I (capital adequacy/liquidity constraints) and Pillar 3 (market disciplinary) approaches to managing risk.  The course then works through a set of real world structures from the banking, hedge fund and corporate sectors.  Each structure is decomposed and analyzed to understand how it works."

Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision- making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing,production, and finance.   The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition.

Study of failures is even used as a quantitative design technique in some engineering disciplines. In fact, it is widely recognized today that failures actually lead to broader and deeper learning that is essential to future success.  While hardly anything today is not e-Business, it is hard to find any e-Business that is immune to failure. Googles foray into mainland China led to an embarrassing withdrawal. Facebooks struggles with privacy problems have been quite public. It seems that some new patent dispute between Apple and Samsung is always brewing.  This course will explore failures, recent and classic, with a focus on e-Business and related aspects. These explorations will be driven by lectures, cases studies and discussions, and through weekly individual and team-based assignments."

We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments.

The goal of this course is to grow in your understanding of conflict and your skill in dealing with it. We have all been touched by conflict in some way; our past experiences become the basis for the many personal ways in which we think and feel about conflict. Our approach to conflict, in turn, determines our behaviors and responses in conflict situations. My goal is to challenge the way you currently think about conflict and to provide you with experiences that will increase your self awareness and confidence when you face conflict.

The goal of the internship is to provide the student with as much experience as possible with the roles and responsibilities of the school principal. A combination of coursework and internship experience should result in a set of competencies that students are expected to possess at the end of their degree.    The requirements for the internship are as follows:    Students must complete a minimum of 108 units (nine 12-unit classes) at the Heinz School before registering for the internship.  Students must successfully complete Educational Leadership (91-880) and Supervision of Instruction (91-881) before registering for the internship.  Students may complete the internship in their own school/district if an opportunity is available or may choose to complete the internship in another district. The internship should provide experience at both the elementary and secondary level (the internship may need to be split to meet this requirement and two mentors would be needed) as the certification is K-12.  The internship experience should be 180 hours and not span more than one semester.  Students must have a mentor(s) to oversee him/her during the internship experience. Typically the mentor(s) is the current principal or assistant principal of the school.  Prior to the start of the internship the mentor(s) should send a letter to the director of the MPM program indicating that they agree to serve as the mentor and briefly outline the types of experiences/opportunities with which they expect that the student will be involved.

The first half concentrates on elaboration of a theoretical framework for policy analysis. This requires a considerable reading load consisting of both theory and cases for analysis.    The second half of the subject is devoted to some specific aspects of the policy analysis process. This allows us to apply theories to issues such as causation in behavioural theory; the special challenges presented by environmental and infrastructure issues; policy and regulatory practice, including agency capture; and public private partnerships. The final two classes deal with two big issues:  Acemoglus theory on why nations fail; and the debate on inequality.   At the end of this class, the students should be able to accomplish the following: -             Critically evaluate policy recommendations using standard tools of policy analysis; -             Prepare a sound, evidence-based policy advice and understand the limitations of the use of evidence in policy-making -             Apply normative and political theory to policy-making   -             Research policy using a wide range of sources -             Apply policy analytic techniques to complex issues such as environmental policy; public private partnerships; health policy interventions; and policy for addressing inequality"

The criterion used by private sector producers in solving similar allocation problems is profit maximization. The analogue in the public sector is maximization of net social benefits. Since it is usually quite difficult to measure theses net benefits indeed it is often very hard even to know what to measure and since the political process does not normally provide clear cut signals for most governmental undertakings it is difficult to know whether the projects contemplated are worthwhile.    The content of cost benefit analysis may be thought of as an attempt to answer a series of questions:       1. What are the rationales for government projects?     2. What is (or should be) a governments objective?     3. Whose social benefits and social costs is the analyst measuring?     4. What is a social cost and what is a social benefit? These questions constitute the heart of the course and lead to such topics as consumer surplus and producer surplus shadow prices (i.e. the value of something like life itself for which the market provides little or no guidance regarding quantifiable value) and externalities or indirect effects.     5. Since many government programs have costs and benefits spread over time how does this affect the analysis?     6. How does one cope with uncertainty?    Not every topic will be discussed in depth. However by the end of the course every student should have a reasonably clear idea of what the cost benefit approach is what its strengths are and where its weaknesses lie. Throughout the course brief examples will be used to make the theory somewhat more meaningful. Similarly    some stylized examples of cost benefit studies will show how oth.Read More

Although the course covers a significant body of technical material, the focus is on managerial challenges rather than technical implementation.  There is no formal prerequisite for this class other than a solid academic standing and some familiarity with software development.  Experience building, designing, specifying, or working with large information systems will be helpful, but is not required.  This course is not appropriate for students who have taken 17-655."

These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited."
