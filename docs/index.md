# CMU Course Analytics Project

This is the the web analytics group project built by Guanqi Yu, Yunlu Huang, Dan Hou for course 95880-A3-SP 2018.
The main page we will use for scrapy and analytics is the [CMU Course Schedule Website](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search)

## Deliverable 1 - Project Proposal

### **Who are your customers?**
CMU students and staffs.

### **What are their needs?**
Students need an easy to use / more interact friendly web interface for them to make simple query for CMU course and needs an insightful course analytics

### **What specific problem(s) will you solve?**
- What courses (in Heinz or SCS) are currently are ongoing right now?
- What is the beginning time and location of specific course
- Which professor/staff teach most of the courses?
- What are the most popular course in this semester?

### **Why do these problems need solved?**
1. Because for simple query, the process of logging into **SIO** and click **Registration** and search for course number/name is too complex. A simple web interface with the ease of simpler process would be more helpful for specific query.
2. Student sometimes need some insight of all of the courses in CMU, while SIO doesn't give too much of that.

### **Where are you going to pull the data from?**
